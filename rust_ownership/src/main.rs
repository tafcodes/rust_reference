        //rather is has to be:
        let s = String::from("this is a bit longer and I'm curious how many chars");

        //also, I believe you could do this:
        let s3 = "heres a thing".to_string();

        //so, String has a method to get one from a str,
        //and str has a method to make a String out of it.

    //What happens if I try to declare a mutable str

    s = "new str"; //but you can reassign the str type s to point
                   //to a different str.

    //this is in contrast to a String,

    //a var that's been 'invalidated' by rusts ownership mechanism

    let a2 = allocated_string;

    //below doesn't work.  We get an error: "borrow of moved value"
    //it is nice enough to show the definition of the old one.
    //println!("after a2, allocated_string is: {}", allocated_string);

    //essentially, there is no "shallow copy"
    //I kind of like that.
    //deep copy is accomplished with .clone()

    let a3 = a2.clone(); //this is a method that is actually simple.

    //if you want to know how a thing will behave, I think you may be able
    //to check whether it implements the Copy trait or the Drop trait

    //how these things behave with functions is interesting...
    //things passed by value (things which impl. the Copy trait)
    //will indeed be copied into the func
    //things passed by ref (things which impl. the Drop trait)
    //will pass "ownership".  So "a valid ptr" is "ownership"?
    //(the old ref is invalidated.)
    //This prevents you from passing something by reference, accidentally
    //modifying it and borking stuff.

    //stack vars, vars that are passed by value, primitives, types
    //which implement the "Copy" trait will behave like this:

    let stack_var: u8 = 255;
    let result_of_halving = half(stack_var); //will infer f32
    println!("halved is : {}", result_of_halving);

    //when it comes to heap-allocated resources:
    //You have a choice.  You can either give the function a .clone()
    //of your heap-allocated resource, using 2x the memory,
    //OR
    //you can give the function the thing by reference, and lose
    //the reference on the call-side, getting it back again on the
    //function's completion.  This forces you to make an assignment
    //and consider therefore the fact that the underlying heap
    //data may have changed!

    //let's do the deep-copy, clone, double-allocation first:
    let heap_string = String::from("This lives on the heap.");
    //below works, but then 'heap_string' is invalid.
    println!("halved is: {}", split_string_in_half(heap_string));
    
    //println!("original was: {}", heap_string);
    //above commented line does NOT work, because heap_string was
    //moved in the previous line, so we can't borrow it.
    //heap_string was invalidated.
    let heap_string_2 = String::from("This also lives on the heap.");
    println!(
        "2halved is: {}",
        split_string_in_half(heap_string_2.clone()),
    );
    //and, now we still have heap_string_2:
    println!("heap_string_2 still lives: {}", heap_string_2);

    // Alright, I've been using the word "by reference" in a C sense.
    // Rust also lets you pass things "by reference", let's see what
    // that is all about....

    //let's supppose we want to do this:
    //    let my_s = String::from("this is my string");
    //    let len = calculate_length(my_s);
    //    println!("Length of '{}' is {}.", my_s, len)
    //we can't.  We have to pass out a reference instead of the String

    //that looks like the below, and also we change calculate_length
    //to accept an arg like (s: &String)
    let my_s = String::from("this is my string");
    let len = calculate_length(&my_s);
    println!("Length of '{}' is {}.", my_s, len);

    //a reference allows you to _refer_ to a variable without taking
    // ---ownership--- of it.  

    //Rust calls this "borrowing"


    let mut s_will_be_modified = String::from("I am in");
    //below won't work:
    //  bad_change(&s_will_be_modified);
    //below WILL work:
    change(&mut s_will_be_modified);
    println!("{}",s_will_be_modified);

    //Another rule, which is going to be awesome for concurrency
    //you can only have 1 mutable reference to a variable at a time.
    //No immutable references may exist at the same time as a mut ref
    
    //HOWEVER
    //Rust has Non Lexical Lifetimes which means things go out of scope
    //after their last use....
    //So, you can do this:
    let mut s = String::from("Will be referenced a few times");
    let r1 = &s; //
    let r2 = &s; //this is OK because 2 immutable refs are allowed at
    //once

    //we cannot do the below borrow, because it's mut and we already
    //have some refs in scope.
    //let r3 = &mut s;
    
    println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
    
    //This however, IS okay, because after r1 and r2 were used last
    //they are out of scope because of NLL.  
    let r4 = &mut s; 
    println!("{}", r4);

    //however, if the below is uncommented, we again get a compile
    //error, because r1 is still valid at the time we're trying to 
    //get a mut ref to s for r4.
    //  println!("{}", r1);


    //Rust's compiler prevents dangling references.  Neat.

    ////
    //Slices:
    ////

    //Slices are references.

    //following the example.  We want the first word of a string,
    //or the entire string if there's no spaces.
    //without slices, we might do something like first_word_idx()

    let mut multi_word_string = String::from("multiple words are here");
    let end_of_first_word_in_multi_word_string = {
        first_word_idx(&multi_word_string);
    };
    multi_word_string.clear();

    //Now we have this "end of first word in multi word string" which sure seems
    //like it should mean something, but now it kind of, in a sense, dangling.

    //what would be nicer is if we use slices....
    let slice_me_nice = String::from("Like a cake that wants to be baked");
    let dessert = &slice_me_nice[7..11];
    println!("dessert is {}", dessert);
    let the_first_word = first_word(&slice_me_nice); //a &str

    //now, this will NOT work, since we have a reference to SOME of this data
    //still.  The compiler will keep our slice valid, because it is just a ref
    //to the original data.
    //   slice_me_nice.clear();
    //ok, so actually the error here is "cannot borrow as mutable", but then,
    //if you go to mark the var as mut, you will get "cannot borrow as mutable"
    //BECAUSE IT IS ALSO BORROWED AS IMMUTABLE, and it will point right at the 
    //line where we returned the slice.
