# Rust Life
I'm learning Rust and this repo is just for a simple Conway's
Life demo, which I will first implement as easily as possible before implementing parallelism.  

## Performance
I may decide to hack on this for a while and see what I can do in terms of either
maximizing iterations-per-time, minimizing memory-usage, or some other fun challenge.

### Log here

When I have initial benchmarks to improve upon, I'll put those here.


## Cheatsheets?
I may use this repo for a little while to hold onto some 
rust snippets to aid my memory.  If that proves useful, I will put them into a separate repo.
